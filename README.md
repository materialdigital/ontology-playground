# PMD Ontology Playground

The PMD Ontology Playground is an interactive, community-driven session with a low entry barrier organized by the Platform MaterialDigital (PMD). It is supposed to serve as a collaborative space for:

* Connecting developers and domain experts in materials science and engineering (MSE).
* Discussing and shaping the PMD Core Ontology (PMDco), which is a mid-level ontology designed to describe processes, experiments, and computational workflows for reproducible materials data.
* Hands-on activities, such as ontology modeling, competency questions, and best practices.
* Community feedback and contributions, allowing participants to propose new terms, report issues, and learn ontology development techniques.

As indicated by its denotation, the Ontology Playground is an open and inclusive space allowing both beginners and experts to discuss, collaborate and ask all kinds of questions with respect to aspects of ontologies and semantic technologies.
The PMD Ontology Playground is part of PMD’s broader effort in connecting people to promote FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) in materials data management and to harmonize ontology design across projects and initiatives.
